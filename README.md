# Solidity_JHUISI_2019
Security research concerning smart contracts using Solidity and Ethereum.  JHUISI 2019.

/contracts      Solidity contracts used during research.
* Re-entrancy
    - EtherStore.sol
    - Attack.sol
    
/py_geth        Python scripts used for automating the blockchain process.
* genesis.py
    - Creates basic genesis.json file used for blockchain initialization.  Takes some command-line arguments.

Future outline:
* Solidity / Ethereum Overview
* Set-up Instructions
    - Geth Installation
    - Geth create private blockchain
    - Add nodes (local or remote)
    - Create wallet and mine test ether
    - Deploy contract
    - Interact with contract
* Solidity Attacks
    - Re-entrancy
